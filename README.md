I have created a config service : which is related to the config repo (in order to get all the config related details for the micro services)
I have created a Eureka discovery service : basically registers the micro services 

There are 2 micro services : Customers and Orders
	it has normal packages like entity, repo -> implementing the JPARepo , services and controller
	Customer -> mysql DB
	Orders -> inbuilt h2 Db

Order service is used for getting the customer information as well (i.e., using feign client) 
	for this we will need to add a model for customer and also a service interface to get the mappings for the required data

We have handled multiple calls failure using Resilience Circuit Breaker @Circuitbreaker + fallback: it is basically written on the order Micro service only and it has different application properties that give us the desired things 

While handling exceptions we also learnt about @bean -> ErrorDecoder which helps to store error messages thrown by another Microservice in this case -> Controller

We also learnt how @RestControllerAdvice removes the need of try catch blocks and helps in making the code look clean: the key need used in this is Problem detail class which is used to store the respective error messages and all.

We have also impelled api gateway : which is the entry point for all the microservices. With the help of adding the predicates , it can basically route to the desired microservices.
